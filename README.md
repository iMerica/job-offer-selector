# Job Offer Selector
A Job Offer Decision Making Framework in Python

## Background
This is a proof of concept framework for selecting job offers.The general idea is to remove 
emotions from the decision making process and first think about whats important to you, then
compare each offer against those things.

The data included is for example purposes only and do not reflect my views about the companies.

## @Todo:
- Make this an interactive CLI (enter priorties, then enter offers, then tell the user which offer to take)
- Containerize, publish to Docker Hub.

## Advice
If everything is important, then nothing is important - so be sure not to mark every category as 10.

## Requirements
Python 3.7 Only!
